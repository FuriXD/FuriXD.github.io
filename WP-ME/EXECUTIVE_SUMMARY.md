# Travel Planning System - Executive Summary

This production-ready travel planning system delivers a comprehensive, secure, and globally-scalable solution for multi-day itinerary generation targeting Claude Sonnet 3.7. The system produces machine-readable JSON itineraries with day-by-day schedules, three-tier cost breakdowns (budget/mid/premium), interactive maps with GeoJSON export, PDF-ready templates, and OAuth+OTP authentication flows. All outputs include security hardening (HTTPS, CSP, rate limiting, parameterized queries, encrypted storage), sponsored content placement with accessibility compliance, and region-specific adaptations for Japan, USA, India, Southeast Asia, and beyond. The architecture leverages @mapbox for mapping, @google OAuth + @twilio OTP for auth, @aws_s3 for storage, and @stripe for payments, with clear API specifications, frontend samples, and developer integration notes covering rate limits, cost estimation methods, and third-party SDK recommendations.
